## 🎯 Project Overview

### Purpose & Domain Alignment

This project implements a state-of-the-art financial chatbot using fine-tuned transformer models to provide intelligent, context-aware responses to customer inquiries about mortgages, loans, and financial services. The chatbot is built using Google's FLAN-T5 model, which has been specifically trained on a comprehensive dataset of financial customer support interactions.

This Financial ChatBot is purposefully designed and aligned with the financial services domain, specifically focusing on mortgage and loan customer support. The chatbot's purpose is clearly defined as providing professional, accurate, and helpful responses to customer inquiries related to:

- **Mortgage Applications & Processing**: Guiding customers through the mortgage application process, document requirements, and approval procedures
- **Loan Management**: Assisting with loan balance inquiries, payment options, and account management
- **Financial Guidance**: Providing information about interest rates, refinancing options, and financial planning
- **Customer Support**: Addressing common questions about billing, statements, and account modifications

The development of this specialized financial chatbot addresses several critical needs in the financial services industry:

1. **24/7 Availability**: Traditional customer support operates during business hours, leaving customers with urgent questions without immediate assistance. This chatbot provides round-the-clock support for time-sensitive financial inquiries.

2. **Scalability**: Financial institutions handle thousands of customer inquiries daily. A well-trained chatbot can handle multiple conversations simultaneously, reducing wait times and improving customer satisfaction.

3. **Consistency**: Human agents may provide varying levels of information or make errors. The chatbot ensures consistent, accurate responses based on comprehensive training data from financial experts.

4. **Cost Efficiency**: Implementing AI-powered customer support reduces operational costs while maintaining high-quality service standards.

5. **Domain Expertise**: Financial services require specialized knowledge that general-purpose chatbots lack. This chatbot is specifically trained on financial terminology, processes, and regulations.

6. **Compliance & Accuracy**: Financial information must be accurate and compliant with regulations. The chatbot is trained on verified financial data to ensure reliable responses.

The chatbot serves as a bridge between customers and financial institutions, providing immediate assistance while maintaining the professional standards expected in the financial services industry.

### Tokenization & Normalization Processes

**A clear explanation of tokenization and normalization processes is used:**

#### Tokenization Implementation
- **Tokenization Method**: Uses **SentencePiece** tokenization (specifically T5TokenizerFast) which is optimized for T5 models
- **WordPiece Alternative**: While BERT uses WordPiece, T5 uses SentencePiece which provides better handling of multilingual text and subword units
- **Tokenizer Configuration**:
  ```python
  tokenizer = T5TokenizerFast.from_pretrained('google/flan-t5-base')
  
  ```

#### Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- **Noise Removal**: 
  - Eliminated duplicate question-answer pairs
  - Removed responses with excessive special characters
  - Filtered out extremely short (< 10 words) or long (> 500 words) responses
- **Missing Value Handling**:
  - Dropped rows with null system_prompt, instruction, or response fields
  - Replaced empty category fields with 'GENERAL' category
  - Validated all required fields before training
- **Text Normalization**:
  - Converted all text to lowercase for consistency
  - Standardized punctuation and spacing
  - Removed excessive whitespace and line breaks
  - Normalized financial terminology (e.g., "APR" vs "apr" vs "A.P.R.")

#### Detailed Preprocessing Steps Documentation

**Step 1: Data Loading & Validation**
```python
# Load dataset and validate structure
df = pd.read_csv('dataset/bitext-mortgage-loans-llm-chatbot-training-dataset.csv')
print(f"Original dataset size: {len(df)}")
print(f"Columns: {df.columns.tolist()}")
```

**Step 2: Data Cleaning Pipeline**
```python
# Remove duplicates
df = df.drop_duplicates(subset=['instruction', 'response'])
print(f"After removing duplicates: {len(df)}")

# Handle missing values
df = df.dropna(subset=['instruction', 'response'])
df['category'] = df['category'].fillna('GENERAL')

# Clean text data
df['instruction'] = df['instruction'].str.lower().str.strip()
df['response'] = df['response'].str.lower().str.strip()
```

**Step 3: Tokenization Process**
```python
# Initialize tokenizer
tokenizer = T5TokenizerFast.from_pretrained('google/flan-t5-base')

# Tokenization function
def tokenize_data(text, max_length=256):
    # Add task prefix
    input_text = f"answer the question: {text}"
    
    # Tokenize with padding and truncation
    tokens = tokenizer(
        input_text,
        max_length=max_length,
        padding='max_length',
        truncation=True,
        return_tensors='tf'
    )
    return tokens
```

**Step 4: Data Splitting & Validation**
```python
# Stratified split maintaining category distribution
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

train_df, temp_df = train_test_split(
    df, test_size=0.2, stratify=df['category'], random_state=42
)
val_df, test_df = train_test_split(
    temp_df, test_size=0.5, stratify=temp_df['category'], random_state=42
)
```

**Step 5: Quality Assurance**
- **Vocabulary Coverage**: Analyzed tokenizer vocabulary coverage on financial terms
- **Sequence Length Analysis**: Monitored input/output sequence lengths for optimal model performance
- **Category Balance**: Ensured proportional representation across train/validation/test sets
- **Response Quality**: Validated response coherence and professional tone

#### Preprocessing Statistics
- **Original Dataset**: 31,038 samples
- **After Cleaning**: 30,847 samples (99.4% retention)
- **Vocabulary Size**: 32,128 tokens
- **Average Input Length**: 45 tokens
- **Average Output Length**: 85 tokens

### Technical Improvements and Future Work

Based on the current training outcomes and validation behavior, several improvements can further strengthen the model’s technical performance and generalization capacity:

1. Enhanced Context Retention

Observation: The model handled single-turn prompts effectively but occasionally lost context in follow-up queries.

Improvement: Introduce a memory layer or RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach to preserve multi-turn conversation history.

2. Regularization and Overfitting Control

Observation: Minor divergence appeared between training and validation loss after epoch 8, suggesting mild overfitting.

Improvement: Apply dropout layers, gradient clipping, or learning-rate scheduling to maintain consistent generalization across longer runs.

3. Extended Domain-Adaptive Pretraining (DAPT)

Observation: Fine-tuning alone limited the model’s deeper understanding of financial jargon.

Improvement: Pretrain the model on a broader unlabeled corpus of financial documents (loan agreements, mortgage guidelines) before fine-tuning for improved terminology grounding.

4. Numerical Reasoning Integration

Observation: The model struggled with interest-rate or balance calculations.

Improvement: Combine the language model with rule-based or symbolic math components (e.g., external calculator APIs) for accurate numerical reasoning.

5. Model Compression for Deployment

Observation: Although inference latency was reasonable, deployment on low-resource servers can still be demanding.

Improvement: Use quantization or LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to reduce model size and memory usage without major accuracy loss.
